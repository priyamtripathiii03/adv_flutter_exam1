# All Countries Flags 

## App Concept:
An "All Countries Flags App" is an app that shows flags of all countries, alongside key information about each country. This type of app can be used for educational purposes, quizzes, or as a reference tool for travelers or those interested in global cultures. In addition to displaying flags, it could provide details such as country name, capital, population, region, and perhaps even fun facts or language information.

## Features of the App:

1. Flag Display: All flags of the world (or specific region sets).
2. Country Information: Country name, capital city, population, area, currency, official languages, etc.
3. Search and Filter: Users can search by country name or filter by region, continent, or language.


## API Description:

There are several APIs available for flag and country data, but one popular option is the Restcountries API. This API provides detailed information about countries, including their flags.
